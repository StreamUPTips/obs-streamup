# StreamUP v2.1.0 - Major Update ðŸš€

We've listened to your feedback and completely rebuilt the StreamUP OBS plugin from scratch. This has been an enormous project that's taken months of work. The plugin remains completely free - if you find it useful, please share it with friends and consider supporting us!

# New Features & What They Do

## Complete Interface Redesign
Fresh, modern UI that makes all our features easily accessible. We've also created a matching StreamUP OBS theme available to monthly supporters.

## New Welcome Screen
Shows what's new, how to support the project, showcases our supporters, and provides all the important links you need.

## StreamUP Toolbar
The OBS Controls dock is bulky and wastes space. Our sleek toolbar gives you access to a lot of controls and hotkeys plus StreamUP settings. Position it at the top, left, right, or bottom of OBS. Enable it in StreamUP > Settings.

## Multi-Dock System  
Combine multiple functions into single, organised docks. Create themed setups like a 'Vertical Canvas' dock with everything for vertical streaming in one place. Perfect for keeping your workspace tidy and efficient.

## Scene Organiser
Organise your scenes into folders and even colour code them. This is based on the SceneTree plugin by DigitOtter with some extra StreamUP spice added such as a search function for your scenes!

## Enhanced WebSocket Commands
Previously available but poorly documented commands now have a proper interface at StreamUP > WebSocket Commands. Copy OBSRaw websocket requests directly for your workflow. Streamer.Bot users can copy CPH (custom C#) code when enabled in settings.

## Dedicated Hotkeys Menu
As StreamUP becomes more feature-rich, we've added our own hotkeys menu that integrates with OBS. Makes it easier to identify which hotkeys belong to StreamUP (though they still appear in the main OBS hotkeys menu).

## Input Capture Device Management
Tired of cameras not activating when OBS starts, or capture cards crashing? This tool lets you enable all devices, disable all devices, or refresh them (turn off and back on). Access via StreamUP > Tools menu, WebSocket, hotkey, or the StreamUP dock.

# Improvements & Bug Fixes

## Better Performance
Enhanced existing features like the OBS plugin update checker. OBS now starts faster because we check for updates after startup instead of during.

## Streamlined Tools Menu
Options in StreamUP > Tools now trigger their function directly instead of opening separate windows. For hotkey or WebSocket access, use the new WebSocket Commands menu and Settings.
