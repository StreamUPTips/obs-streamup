# StreamUP v2.0.0 - Major Update ðŸš€
We have listened to all of your feedback and completely rewritten the StreamUP OBS plugin from the ground up. This has been a HUGE task and taken so much time. This plugin is still free and it would mean the world to use if you could share it with a friend and even grab us a beer or something!

Below is everything you need to know in v2.0.0 of the StreamUP OBS Plugin!

# Individual Features & What They Do

## Complete Face Lift
- We wanted to create a fresh modern looking UI since our plugin is packed with features we wanted to make them easily accessible for everyone. We have also developed the StreamUP OBS Theme following this new design standard. Anyone supporting StreamUP or Andi with monthyl memberships get access to this theme!

## New Welcome / About Screen
- Shows you what's new, how to support the project, showcase our supporters and also give you all the links you could need!

## StreamUP Toolbar
- We hate the Controls dock in OBS, it's bulky and takes up room. We made a sleek toolbar that gives you access to all these controls and the StreamUP Settings. It can be placed at the Top, Left, Right or Bottom of OBS. You can enable it and access the Toolbar Settings in StreamUP > Settings.

## Multi-Dock System
- Add multiple docks to one single dock. Organise your workspace exactly how you like it. This means you could create a 'Vertical Canvas' dock where you can have everything to do with your Vertical setup in one single dock. You can make as many docks as you like too. This is perfect if you're a neat freak like Andi lol!

## WebSocket Commands
- A lot of these have been available in the StreamUP plugin for some time but they were very poorly documented... Yes, Andi sucks at documentation... and yes, I am Andi talking about myself in the 3rd person lol. All these can be accessed from StreamUP > WebSocket Commands. All the details about the WebSocket function are there and you can even copy the OBSRaw websocket request to easily use them in your workflow. Since we love Streamer.Bot we have added a way to copy the CPH (Streamer.Bot custom C#), this needs to be enabled in settings.

## Hotkeys
- Since the StreamUP plugin is getting pretty complicated now and we have even crazier stuff coming soon (follow our socials and Andi's Twitch streams to find out) We have added our own Hotkeys menu that integrates with OBS' hotkeys menu. It is just to make your life easier when working out what hotkeys are StreamUP hotkeys etc. We cannot find a way to hide these in the OBS hotkeys menu (sorry!).

## Input Capture Device Management
- Ever get annoyed when you start OBS and your camera isn't active or maybe your Capture Card crashes and you need to Deactivate it then Reactivate it? Well this tool does just that. You can enable all Input Capture Devices, disable all Input Capture Devices and refresh all Input Capture Devices (Turn the ones that are on, off. Then turn them back on) You can access it in the StreamUP > Tools menu, WebSocket, Hotkey or via the StreamUP Dock.

# Tweaks & Bug Fixes

## Improve Efficiency
- We improved many old features such as checking your OBS plugins for updates. It now shouldn't take as long for OBS start since we check after startup now!

## Tools Menu Changes
- In the StreamUP > Tools menu the options there will now just trigger that particular function, rather than opening a separate UI. If you want to trigger these options via HotKeys or WebSocket, those options are in the new Websocket Commands menu and Settings menu.
